The section covers the naming and content of Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) including the required and recommended sections.  There are lots of rules governing the content, developed over many years in order, which aim to ensure the readability and consistency of I-Ds.  Please follow this section closely.  The pages in this section are:

- [Naming your Internet-Draft *I-Ds have strict naming rules*](/naming-your-internet-draft)
- [Required content *Your I-D will not validate without this required content*](/required-content)
- [Recommended content *(Optional) These sections are recommended for most I-Ds*](/recommended-content)
- [Language and style *Important for your I-D to be read and understood*](/language-and-style)
- [Diagrams *(Optional) Diagrams help simplify otherwise complex interactions and concepts*](/diagrams)
- [Formal languages  *(Optional) For example, ABNF or YANG*](/formal-languages)
- [Protocol checklist *(Optional) Specific details for protocol defintions and references*](/protocol-checklist)
- [Example addresses *How to add example addresses both Internet and pre-Internet*](/example-addresses)
