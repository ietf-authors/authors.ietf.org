# Introduction
While there are many tools that can be used by I-D authors, there are some that have been specifically developed to support I-D authors and are commonly referred to.  This catalog is a reference catalog for these tools and is intended to supplement the task/context-specific mentions of the tools elsewhere in this documentation, not replace it.

# Feature classification of tools
The catalog below includes a feature classification which lists the following for each tool:
## Supported modes
The tools generally support one or more of the following modes of operation:

- Interactive **Editor** 
- Command Line Interface (**CLI**).  Where the author installs the tools locally and then runs them on local files from the command line, one operation at a time.
- Automated **Build** process. Where the author(s) installs the tools into a build manager that then runs a sequence of tools on a source target.  This allows for a continuous integrated build process much as software developers use when building code. 
- **Web** service. This can be broken down into two sub-modes:
    - Where the author uses an interactive web page that in turns calls a remote web service, on individual local files generally one operation at the time.
    - Where the author(s) configures their build service to use a remote web service via an API instead of installing the tools. 

## Supported operations
The tools generally provide one of more of the following broad operations:

-  **Convert** the document from one format to another such as from XML to PDF.
-  **Validate** that the format/structure of the document source conforms to the format/structure rules for an I-D/RFC.
-  **Extract** part of the document. For example, extracting a code module such as YANG, MIB or ABNF and passing it to a separate validator. 
-  **Insert** new text into an I-D. This may be boilerplate, references, new sections or other custom text.
-  **Compare** two different I-Ds or two versions of an I-D.
-  Supports an interactive **Editor** with features such as auto-completion.

## Supported formats
The formats that we are aware of tools supporting include: AsciiDoc, DOCX, EPUB, LaTeX, Markdown, nroff, Org Mode, PDF, plaintext, RFCXML, as well as the formal languages of ABNF, MIB, YANG and SVG.

Some tools only support the previous version of RFCXML (v2) and the format is written as RFCXML(old) in the table where that occurs, as well as "No" in the "Supports v3" column.

# Miscellaneous tools
There are a number of miscellaneous tools, not directly related to drafting I-Ds and not included in the catalog, that authors may find useful:

- **[ietf-cli](https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietf-cli/)**
A multi-functional command line tool for manipulating I-Ds and RFCs and local repositories.

- **[print_rfc_or_draft](https://www.kumari.net/index.php/programming/programmingcat/45-printrfcordraft)**
A simple program that prints an Internet Draft (ID) or RFC. Because of the difference between the number of lines on laser printers and line / dot-matrix printers, each "page" of the draft actually takes up 2 pages and you end up with lots of pages with just a one line footer. This script tries to fix that by downloading the draft, converting it to a PDF and then printing it.

- **[Rewrite IETF ID URLs to Tools or Datatracker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rewrite-ietf-id-urls-to-t/aiccdpabeagpjcebilebhlifplfkinao)**
Google Chrome extension that rewrites I-D URLs that point to www.ietf.org to point to datatracker.ietf.org or tools.ietf.org. 

- **[RFC-what-I-mean](https://www.strayalpha.com/tools/)**
Checks a list of RFCs to find the most recent list and their dependents. It needs to run with a copy of rfc-index.txt as input.

- **[rfc-mode](https://github.com/galdor/rfc-mode)**
A plugin Emacs major mode that provides support for reading RFCs.
